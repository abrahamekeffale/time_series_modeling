Time Series Forecasting Project
This project explores time series forecasting using various models.

Tasks
Data Preparation:
Ensure data consistency:
Check data length for train_data and test_data.
Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, interpolation).
Consider feature engineering (moving averages, momentum, volatility indicators).
ARIMA Model:
Import ARIMA from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model.
Use grid search or pmdarima (if compatible numpy version) to find optimal p, d, and q values.
Fit the model using model.fit().
Forecast future values using model_fit.forecast(steps=len(test_data)).
Evaluate the model using mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Â  
SARIMA Model (Optional):
Import SARIMAX from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.
Use grid search to find optimal parameters for p, d, q, P, D, Q, and s (seasonal parameters).
Follow similar steps to ARIMA model training, forecasting, and evaluation.
LSTM Model (Optional):
Reshape data into sequences with a fixed look-back length.
Implement an LSTM model using tensorflow.keras.Sequential.
Train the model on X_train and y_train.
Forecast future values using model.predict(X_test).
Evaluate the model using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
Model Selection and Comparison:
Compare evaluation metrics from ARIMA, SARIMA (if implemented), and LSTM (if implemented).
Choose the model with the lowest error metrics and consider interpretability and overfitting risks.
Visualize forecasts (actual vs. predicted values) for comparison.
Note:

Replace placeholders like train_data and test_data with your actual data.
Consider using virtual environments and dependency management tools for a clean project setup.
Additional Notes
This is a general guide. You might need to adapt the code depending on your specific data and chosen models.
Feel free to explore further techniques like data normalization, hyperparameter tuning strategies, and advanced evaluation metrics.
